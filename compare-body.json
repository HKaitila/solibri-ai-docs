  "articleContent": "What's the difference between a Solibri Subscription and a Solibri perpetual license?\n\nSubscription for Solibri Office is available as an individual subscription for single user (billed monthly or annually) and as a subscription seat.\n\nPerpetual Solibri licenses are no longer available as new purchases. Existing perpetual licenses can be assigned to multiple users in a user group. A perpetual license allows you to use a specific version of Solibri Office indefinitely, with no expiration.\n\nFor the latest versions and assistance with upgrading, please contact us."
